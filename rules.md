### House Rules

_Much of this list is based on actual events ;)_

##### General
* The hot tub is low-chlorine. You must shower before using it.
  * Please wipe dirt from your feet before entering the tub
* Cleanup your dishes (before you leave the house). 
* If you use the dishwasher, you must empty and put away _all__ the dishes from the dishwasher.
* If you put garbage in the neighbor's bin your deposit will be impacted.
* Please do not park in the neighbor's property.
* Do not dump trash in the neighbor's bear box. There is NO bear box at my property.
* No tents or camping on the lawns.
* Please no fires outside.

##### Kitchen

* Please try not to lean back on the kitchen chairs as the legs will separate from the seat.
* Please do not leave any garbage outside. 
* Seriously _do not_ dump food into the sinks. Pasta, coffe grounds, rice and knives have all been found in the right side sink. Those people paid the plumbers bill to take care of that.
* Do not use _Cheries_ laundry detergent

##### Garbage
* Garbage is collected at 8AM Fridays, _so_ take recycling and garbage down to the bins in the garage Thursday night and Cherie will put out the garbage Friday AM. 
  * Leave recycling bags on the garage floor (do not put in the bins).
* You must put out your buts and _all_ garbage away and cannot leave _any_ of it on the grounds, decks etc.
  * This goes for any items you bring to the house, such as cardboard boxes
  * All recycling must be put in the blue bags
  * Cardboard must _also_ be put into the blue recycling bags.
  * Do not leave your store-bought inflatables' cardboard at my house (please)
* Do not do any laundry here unless you made those clothes dirty during your stay here. In particular, if come from a camping trip with laundry (or bring your dirty laundry from home) you cannot do it here. (If you must, please contact me ahead of time).

##### Neighborhood Regulations
The other people who live along the river have asked me to convey this to any people who use the shared road:

You, as the designated renter are required to agree to the following:

* The roadway: I understand that River Road is a private driveway utilized by walkers, children at play, and unleashed dogs. I agree not to exceed a 15 MPH speed limit.
* Fire Danger: Fireworks and open fires are prohibited at all times. 
* Quit enjoyment: I will ensure that guests respect the rights of their neighbors to a quiet enjoyment of their properties. Should I wish entertain outdoors, I will notice my neighbors and respect a reasonable time to move indoors. 
* No loud noise whatsoever after midnight.

###### Daybed Room
The accordion door leads from this room directly to steps to the living room. You must acknowledge this so as to not hurt yourself if you use that door. Additionally, that room has sliding doors that lead to the kitchen.

##### Airbnb Checkin

* Early checking is only available if there is no one staying at the house the night before the day of your reservation
  * If you contact me close to the time I can tell you if someone has booked the house that night before
