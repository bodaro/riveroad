Very Important:
============
1) Drive slow on the road.
2) Put garbage in garage (which is through the laundry door off the dining area, down the stairs and via the door on the left). If you put garbage in the neighbor's bin your deposit will be impacted.
3) No noise after midnight.
4) Please do not park in the neighbor's property.
5) Do not dump trash in the neighbor's bear box. There is NO bear box at my property.
6) You must shower before using the hot tub. This is important as it is a low chlorine tub. Please wipe dirt from your feet before entering the tub.
7) There are hazards on the property. The steps to the spa are hazardous too.

Kitchen
=======
-Please try not to lean back on the kitchen chairs as the legs will separate from the seat.
-Please do not leave any garbage outside. Please use the blue bag bin for recyclables. Bring your garbage down to the bins in the garage (if the bins are full, leave garbage in the garage). Do not leave the garbage at the neighbors house.
-Extra supplies are under the kitchen sink (where else?)
-The cleaners are not your maids and expect you to do your own dishes. If you don't an extra fee will be added (by the cleaners) to the cleaning fee.
-Before leaving make sure your dishes are clear of the counters and sink or put in the dishwasher. Please do not start the dishwasher - the cleaners will do that.
-When using the dishwasher, make sure the detergent flap is not blocked. Also, sometimes the washer will stop mid-way. And must be manually started again (go Kenmore).
-If you use dishwasher tablets make sure to peel off the foil.*
-Do not leave your spoons in the garbage disposal*
-Don't use metal for non-stick pots and pans*
-Please leave the place in reasonable condition (no burnt food on stove or oven for example) or else there will be extra deducted from your deposit.

Bathrooms
=========
-Extra toilet paper is located in the middle cupboard
-The master bathroom sink drips

Internet
========
-The wifi is canard and there is no password. If that is down, try resetting the 2 modems and then the "wifi router" (the box with the 3 antennas).
If canard is not working you can try mallard and goose.

Lights and Switches
===================
-Living room lights and fans switches are located to the right of the big window.
-Dining table lights to the right of the garbage disposal switch which is right of the sink.
-There are 2 hall switches.
-There are 2 thermostats, on in the living room and one in the master bedroom. Please try not to adjust them.
-There is a switch for the outdoor lights near the sliding glass door in the living room
-There is no A/C. If its hot, keep the house cool in the day by keeping the curtains closed and in the evening open the windows and doors to let the house cool.
-the circuit breaker box is located on the south wall of the garage near the green door

Hot Tub
=======
-Please no more than 4 people in the hot tub at once (it is a low chlorine tub and cannot handle large groups in the tub at once). If the tub cannot be brought back to clear water with regular chemical treatment, there will be a $100 dump fee. To avoid this fee shower before entering the tub (especially important as its a low chlorine tub). If you do not shower, its likely the dump fee will be charged.
Please wipe your feet of debris before entering the tub.
The tub steps are hazardous.

General
=======
-Please don't throw axes at the trees*
-Please do not move the furniture (our cleaners cannot move some furniture such as the bunk bed)
-If theres any issues, call or text me at: 415-999-8762

Hazards
=======
-Please note: use of property is at your own risk.
-There are hazards all over the grounds. These include sprinkler heads and items used to protect or mark those heads. 
-The river itself can be dangerous. 
-The steps can be slippery (especially when walking to the hot tub).
-The propane shutoff is on the south wall (the garage wall, near the front).
-Note that the  river can be dangerous. People have been pinned against the logs and big rocks when it is flowing fast*.
-No fireworks, open fires or flames.
-None of the bedrooms have locks or closets
-If you smoke, you must crush and wet all your buts. Do not put buts anywhere until you have put water on them (this is to avoid fire). 
-You must out your buts and all garbage away and cannot leave it on the grounds, decks etc.
-Do not do any laundry here unless you made those clothes dirty during your stay here. In particular, if come from a camping trip with laundry (or bring your dirty laundry from home) you cannot do it here. (If you must, please contact me for the fee).

Neighborhood
===========
-Do not ask the neighbors directions. Directions are supplied to you (as well as the code for the lockbox) by Airbnb. Make sure your entire party knows the directions and do not ask neighbors at 1AM* how to get "to the end of the road".
-Do not dump trash in the neighbor's bear box. There is NO bear box at my property.

-Do not go more than 10 m.p.h. on the road. It is really a driveway and not a road.
-Do not make any noise after midnight. If you bother the neighbors and they contact me you will be evicted.
-Do not go on the neighbor's property (past the rocks upriver)

Dogs
====
-Do not allow your dogs to wander off the property, Make sure to pick up any dog poop. -Be especially careful that your dogs do not poop on the neighbor's property. I realize that other neighborhood dogs will poop on the property, but that is no excuse for you to not pick up your dog's poops.
-Dogs are $10 per dog per night.

* means: "Please do not be dumb" (these things have happened) ;)
