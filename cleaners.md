##### Ensure
1. Replenish Supplies: master bedroom closet contains supplies. Make sure there is enough supplies for the guests. Bathroom supplies can be left in the middle closet/shelf of each bathroom. Kitchen supplies (including garbage bags) can be left under the kitchen sink. If you want to leave extra supplies that dont fit in the kitchen or bathrooms then leave those supplies on the bottom shelves of the hallway closet. The rest should be locked up in the master bedroom closet.
2. Close all blinds (except the large window in the living room). Turn off all lights. Leave the light switch for the front outside on. This is the switch near the front door (on the inside). The switch should be up.
3. Place sheets: master should have 2 queen sets. Front bedroom 1 queen set. All the rest fo the queen sheets go into drawer in front bedroom. Bunk room has 1 double sheet set out and 2 single sets set out on the top bunk. The remaining single and double sets can go into the closet in the bunk room.
4. Towels: can go into each bathroom. extras go into the hall closet. Make sure soap, toilet paper, shampoo and conditioner in bathrooms.
5. Reset thermostats to 55. There is one thermostat in master and one in living room. All functions are done on the display screen. Click/press the temperature, when its flashing click the up/down arrows next to temperature to set to 55. Then press the "HOLD" button in bottom left corner until HOLD appears in the top right corner.
6. Take down garbage and recycling to bins in garage. For special weeks (when tenants are not here) please take garbage to the dump.
7. Check for damage: Check all "good" knives in the block. Check couches, dining room table and chairs for damage.
8. Check the hot tub.  If it looks dirty let me know by text message.
9. Lock Up: Lock the Master bedroom closet: your master key locks this door. Make sure its locked before leaving (even if you didnt open it). Lock the door to the laundry.
