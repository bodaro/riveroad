There is an older single full-time tenant in a separate unit below the house. She usually stays out of the way but can help out as needed.

You are guests in this home. Please enjoy it and treat it with the same care and respect that you would your own home. I really mean this. Unhappy people will find plenty of things not to their liking with this house.

The number of individuals in the home and on the property is not to exceed the number of guests listed on your reservation, or the maximum occupancy of the home, at any time. Smoking is strictly prohibited anywhere on the property. This a family residential neighborhood that does not have tolerance for loud parties.

While the house is cleaned to hotel standards when you arrive, at the end of the day this is not a hotel. Please don't expect that standard of service. Occasionally things break, contractors need to visit the house and can be premises. Please don't take home any of the supplied amenities (like toothpaste and toilet paper).

Please take garbage down to garage and never to the neighbor's bear box.
Please do not go onto the neighbor's property (up river beyond the rocks).

Neighborhood Regulations:
You, as the designated renter are required to agree to the following:

The roadway. I understand that River Road is a private driveway utilized by walkers, children at play, and unleashed dogs. I agree not to exceed a 15 MPH speed limit.

Fire Danger. Fireworks and open fires are prohibited at all times. 

Quit enjoyment.  I will ensure that guests respect the rights of their neighbors to a quiet enjoyment of their properties. Should I wish entertain outdoors, I will notice my neighbors and respect a reasonable time to move indoors. No loud noise whatsoever after midnight.

Daybed Room: the accordion door leads from this room directly to steps to the living room. You must acknowledge this so as to not hurt yourself if you use that door. Additionally, that room has sliding doors that lead to the kitchen.

No rooms have locks or closets.

I have read this document and understand these simple rules. I agree to abide by these rules during my visit. I will inform any members of the my rental party of these rules.
