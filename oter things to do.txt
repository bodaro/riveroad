Quiet, peaceful. In nature. There are hiking trails along the river that lead to a trail going up to the Tahoe Rim Trail. The house is close to the bike path that follows the river to Tahoe City and beyond. We are located at the entrance to Squaw Valley (the ski resort) directly on the river. It is 7 miles south of Truckee and 5 miles from Tahoe City (and Lake Tahoe).
