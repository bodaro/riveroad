* The umarked turnoff for bridge #2 is located about 1000 ft. north of the lights at squaw valley and Hwy 89. 

##### From the South
If traveling south from Truckee, look for the driveway on your left just after the green "squaw valley" turnoff sign (which is just before the 7-11 on the right side of the road). 

##### From the North
If traveling north from Tahoe City, look for the turn to the right about 1000 ft. after the lights (the driveway is after the "Hwy 89" sign and before the "55 m.p.h." sign). 

##### Both Directions
After the turn, you _may_ see a wooden sign with _Bridge #2_. Follow the road over the bridge, turn left just after the bridge and go to the end of the road. Front door is up the steps on the deck.

At the house, to the right of the upper front door (the door on the deck) is a lockbox. There is 1 key in there. Please replace that key.
