### Info about the House

  * Bring your garbage down to the bins in the garage 
  * If the bins are full, leave garbage in the garage. 
  * Do not leave the garbage at the neighbors house.
* Extra supplies are under the kitchen sink (where else?)
* The dishwasher works. 
    * When loading, make sure nothing blocks the "door" that releases the detergent. 
	* Sometimes (mid cycle) it will switch itself off and then you need to hit the start button again.
    * When using the dishwasher, make sure the detergent flap is not blocked. 
	* If you use dishwasher tablets make sure to peel off the foil.

* There is a separate beverage fridge which can be used when the main fridge is full.
* Most kitchen cleaning agents, garbage bags, blue recycling bags are under the kitchen sink
* _Never_ take metal spoons anywhere near the teflon pots (why do I even have to mention this?)

* For Airbnb:
	* Before leaving make sure your dishes are clear of the counters and sink or put in the dishwasher. Please do not start the dishwasher,  the cleaners will do that.
	* Please leave the place in reasonable condition (no burnt food on stove or oven for example) or else there will be extra deducted from your deposit.
	* The garage is through the laundry door off the dining area, down the stairs and via the door on the left). 
	* The cleaners are not your maids and expect you to do your own dishes. If you don't an extra fee will be added (by the cleaners) to the cleaning fee.

##### Laundry and Bathrooms

* There is toothpaste, basic shampoo and coniditoner, hand/pump soap and bar soap in the bathrooms
  * Please don't take these supplies homw with you
* Extra toilet paper is located in the middle cupboard or shelf (of each bathroom)
* Laundry detergent is in the cupboard above the washing machine (in the laundry)
  * do not use _Cherie's_ detergent et al (which is _also_ located in the cupboard above the washing machine)


##### Internet

* The wifi is _duck_ and there is no password. If that is down, try resetting the 2 _ATT modems_ which are _mallard_ and _goose_.
* If canard is not working you can try mallard and goose
  * Each of those are the direct wifi signals from the 2 ATT modems
  * The ATT modems are located in the living room

##### Lights and Switches

* Living room lights and fans switches are located to the right of the big window.
* There is a thermostat in the living room and master bedroom. 
  * The heat is _hydronic_ and takes a while to come up to speed
* Dining table lights to the right of the garbage disposal switch which is to the right of the _kitchen_ sink.
* There are 2 hall light switches.
* There is a switch for the outdoor lights near the sliding glass door in the living room
* There is no A/C. If its hot, keep the house cool in the day by keeping the curtains closed and in the evening open the windows and doors to let the breeze blow through.

##### Electrical and Garage

* Lockbox code and garage PIN are the same
* There should be a fire extinguisher in the living room near the fireplace and in the laundry room
  * please check when you arrive
* The circuit breaker box is located on the south wall of the garage near the green door
* The propane shutoff is on the south wall (the garage wall, near the front green door).
* There is a propane powered generator
  * It should power the whole house and the hot tub
  * It runs a test every Tuesday around noon
  * It should automatically starup when the main power to the house is lost
  * Please do not place anything near or on top when it is running (it requires plenty of airflow)

##### Heat

* The thermostats are programmed. Best to follow the program. Leave house at 55 when you leave.
* There are 2 thermostats (living room and master bedroom). 
  * Master does all 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 
  * Living room does the rest (living room, small bathroom, kitchen, laundry). 
* The correct temperature when there is no one overnight at the house is to HOLD at 55 degrees. 
  * Press HOLD then press the numbers and then up/down arrows to set to 55 (see below).

###### You can alter the current temperature in 2 ways using the touchscreen on the thermostat:

  * OVERRIDE: When changing the set point, the top-row shows "OVERRIDE" and the newly set temperature will remain until the next program period (there are 4 program periods per day). 
  * HOLD: At any time you can press the HOLD button (in the lower left of the screen). This will display "HOLD" in the top row. This will keep the set point (not the current temperature but what it is set to) forever. View the set point by touching the number and noting the number displayed when it is flashing.
  * IMPORTANT: touch the number, and when it flashes (the flashing number is the set point) set the temperature using the up and down arrows. 

###### Locked out?

* If the thermostat displays _locked_ you can reset by:
  * remove the thermostat from its plastic holding bracket (look for the tabs)
  * press the rest button on the back of the thermostst
  * put it back
  * set the temperature
  
##### Hot Tub

* Please no more than 4 people in the hot tub at once
* If the tub cannot be brought back to clear water with regular chemical treatment, there will be a $100 dump fee.
* We use a low chlorine system so a shower is required to make sure we dont have to dump the tub.
* Shower before entering - we all do this (this is absolutely neccessary or else the tub will get dirty right away because we keep a low chlorine level)
* Please be careful when removing the cover
* Easiest to access hot tub via the deck through the master bedroom.
* Those stairs are slippery (even when shovelled). Always use the handrail.
* The tub steps are hazardous as well
* Did you walk to the tub in bare foot on dirt? wipe your feet before getting into the tub

* For the Ski Lease:	
	* The hot tub is clothing optional
	* Leave the tub at 104. 

##### General

* Please don't throw axes at the trees

* For Airbnb:
	* Please do not move the furniture (our cleaners cannot move some furniture such as the bunk bed)
	* If theres any issues, call or text me
	* No rooms have locks or closets.

##### Hazards

* Please note: use of property is at your own risk.
* There are hazards all over the grounds. These include sprinkler heads and items used to protect or mark those heads. 
* The river itself can be dangerous. 
* The steps can be slippery (especially when walking to the hot tub).
* Note that the  river can be dangerous. People have been pinned against the logs and big rocks when it is flowing fast
* No fireworks, open fires or flames.
* If you smoke, you must crush and wet all your buts. Do not put buts anywhere until you have put water on them (this is to avoid fire). 

##### Neighborhood

* Do not ask the neighbors directions. 
  * Directions are supplied to you (as well as the code for the lockbox) by Airbnb (or by myself for the skiers). 
  * Make sure your entire party knows the directions and do not ask neighbors at 1AM* how to get "to the end of the road".
* Do not dump trash in the neighbor's bear box. There is NO bear box at my property.
* Do not go more than 10 m.p.h. on the road. It is really a driveway and not a road.
* Do not make any noise after midnight. If you bother the neighbors and they contact me you will be evicted.
* Do not go on the neighbor's property (past the rocks upriver)

##### Dogs

* For Airbnb and ski cabin guest dogs: Dogs are $20 per dog per night.
* Guest dogs are generally discouraged, however, we do understand that occasionally a situation warrants inviting a guest dog.
* Do not allow your dogs to wander off the property, 
  * Even though many neighbor dogs come to this property, nonetheless, make sure to pick up any of _your_ dog's poops.
  * It is suggested that dog owners continually monitor the property/driveway for poop. Please be mindful all dog owners share this task.
  * Be especially careful that your dogs do not poop on the neighbor's property. 
  * I realize that other neighborhood dogs will poop on the property, but that is no excuse for you to not pick up your dog's poops.
* You must crate your dog if you leave it alone in the house. There are no exceptions here. 
  * Any crated dog must not make noise or bark in distress, as this is unreasonable in shared space.
  * In the past, dogs were left alone in a strange house (in the woods). Invariably they destroy something trying to espace.
  * Typically they will scratch the doors, trim around the doors and doorjams.
  * The cleaners will inspect closely for any damage and you will be responsible for re-sanding and staining the door and trim
  * In the past dogs have also ripped up the kitchen floor (you will see the result of that when you enter the house). I don't appreciate this.
* Guest dogs must have an agreeable temperament that aligns well with other dogs, there are typically member dogs who are at the house. 
* Dog capacity for any time is 3 dogs. This means that if all three member dogs are on property then there is no space for guest dogs.
* Guest dogs must be on the schedule, and the ski lease member and/or their owner must coordinate their stay with member dogâ€™s owners that are on the calendar for said stay.
* If any dog destroys property the member will be liable for damages.
* It is preferred that all dogs coming to the house are no longer in the puppy stage of life, as puppies tend to have more behavior challenges.

##### Lost and Found (for Airbnb)

* Cherie _can_ send your forgotten stuff back to you if it goes via USPS
* You can pay via the Airbnb app plus $10 for her time 
* She may not do this for everyone
