### Ski Cabin Information

##### General

* Lease is 5PM December 01, 2019 through and including 5PM May 31, 2020
  * Mid-Week is noon Sunday to 6PM Friday each and every week
* Use Venmo for guest fees.
* Calendar: Always use it and keep it accurate. Others are relying on the accuracy of people's plans.
* Cleaning: At the end of your visit, clean the bathroom (including the toilet) you used. 
  * Supplies/toilet paper are under the sinks (in kitchen and bathrooms) and extra supplies are in the master bedroom closet. 
* Room assignment: anyone in the cabin can take over room assignment for a weekend. Weekday members should sort it out themsleves. 
  * The golden rule is "people who have used the preferred rooms more than others should give up their rooms when other members arrive"
* Never leave anything (especially a shovel) in the driveway. 
  * It will get buried in snow and the plow will hit it and break and give us a costly bill. 
  * Always put shovels back (as some are Cherie's and she needs to be able to find it).
* There is a key for you on a keyring or in a red plastic bowl in the top drawer in the kitchen.

##### Food

* You can keep food on one of the shelves in the laundry room (or on a shelf in the big white cupboard in the laundry room)
* You can keep your food in the fridge and freezer while you are not staying at the cabin as long as you label it 
  * Otherwise people are free to use it or throw it out (this is to prevent old food from taking root in the fridge)
