##### Dogs

* You must crate your dog if you leave it alone in the house. There are no exceptions here. 
  * In the past, dogs were left alone in a strange house (in the woods). Invariably they destroy something trying to espace.
  * Typically they will scratch the doors, trim around the doors and doorjams.
