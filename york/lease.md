### Lease Information

The purpose of this page is to give you an idea of the important items in the lease before you consider renting here

#### Important Items to consider before making an appointment to view

* Price $6250. Garage is available $250/month extra
* Application through Zumper or Cozy for credit checks and rental history (they pay)
* Payment each month through cozy or zumper? (my choice) and is ACH and no fee to them or me. Iff they add a fee in future they pay or setup direct ACH to my bank
* Need to have $100k liability insurance (may come with contents insurance, renters policy)
* May need to furnish with some percentage of carpet on hardwoods for downstairs neighbors sanity (she is quiet but will drink you under the table)
* 1 person on master lease (meaning just 1 person on the lease with me, they can have leases with their friends or not)
* That one person can talk to me anytime but arrange with text first
* It has tons of light in the daytime, best seen before it gets dark
* No pets, subletting or airbnb-style (unless you want to split the profit)
