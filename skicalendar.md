### Ski Calendar

##### Test

Each cabin member _must_ enter a test event on the shared calendar. I will check the calendar and after a couple of days, if I dont see your event I will bug you via email or text asking you to add it. 

_Please add yourself to the calendar for Dec 2._
_Please select "all day"._

The test is needed because most, if not all people, end up adding events to their default calendar instead of the ski cabin calendar.

##### About the calendar
* In general when adding events, add the event as "all day" (otherwise is clutters up the calendar) 
* Add and entry for each _day_ you will be there (not each night)
  * For example, if coming for the weekend, select the Friday, Saturday and the Sunday
  * Make the event "all day" not a time period
* Last year we had more than 1 event where people added themselves to their own calendar
  * As well as several events where people left themselves on the calendar (which causes other people not to bring their friends as they thought the cabin would be too full)
* We have a policy where mis-calendared entries result in you achieving guest status
* If you login with your gmail account you can visit [_Google calendars_](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r "All Google calendars") to see the calendar
* Or you can click the link on the group email (to follow) and maybe find the calendar in the google group web page also at [_Google group_](https://groups.google.com/ "Google group")

##### Troubleshooting

###### Google Group
The [_Google group_](https://groups.google.com "Google group") is used for receiving emails. 

To access the group, _login_ to google and search for out google group. Once there, you can click on _something_ to have emails automatically sent to you _regular_ email address (otherwise the messages are just viewable in the group).

Note: I will have explicitly added you to the group and sent the group link in a separate email.

###### Calendar
The calendar is separate from the group. I added each ski cabin member and you will have already received an invite.
You can see _all_ your [_Google calendars_](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r "All Google calendars").

You _may_ have to use a _Google/Gmail_ account to see the ski cabin calendar.
You can also add the calendar to existing calendar apps (like ical or apps on your phone) that support the protocol.

Note: I never login to either google groups or google calendar. I use the ski cabin calendar as 1 of several on my laptop and phone. And I setup the group to send emails to my regular email address.
